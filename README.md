## TECH STACK

### Python libraries:
* BeautifulSoup - for webscraping.
* pandas - for sorting thru the scraped data & displaying the results.
* nltk, spaCy, PolyFuzz, TextBlob - for Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities.

NOTE: NLP is simply the processing & understanding the text using  methods such as "semantic similarity", "sentiment analysis". By leveraging NLP Python libraries, we can understand how people feel towards certain "instances"  "most popular" & "most recommended" instances of the user-specified "phrase" existing on the list of websites.

NOTE: Streamlit is used for running & interacting with the Python code via web app. For more info on Streamlit, see the developer docs here: https://docs.streamlit.io/
